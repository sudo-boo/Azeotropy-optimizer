The values for which I got minimum were:
    
    C = 253.76884422110552
    R = 46.35678391959799

And the minimum cost found was:
    
    T = 32.433675076245216

These values can also be seen when you run the final-solutions.py.

It is highly suggested to run the code as it is more intuitive that just the
description of confidence intervals and the prediction of the data points.
